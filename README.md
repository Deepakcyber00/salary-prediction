# Salary-Prediction-using-Census-Data
This is a machine learning algorithm that has been trained using a dataset of salary information from a census. The purpose of this algorithm is to make predictions about an individual's salary based on their level of experience. In simpler terms, it takes into account the number of years someone has worked and provides an estimate of their expected salary. The algorithm uses patterns and relationships learned from the census data to make these predictions, allowing it to generalize and make salary predictions for new, previously unseen cases.
